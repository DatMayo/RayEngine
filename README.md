# RayEngine
A "Game-Engine" with predefined Objects and more using Raylib-CsLo - EDUCATIONAL ONLY
At this current state, RayEngine is EDUCATIONAL ONLY due to the fact it's mainly porpuse is to demonstrate the power of RayLib with Combination of C# itself.
I personally use it to show students what you can archive with those given tools!
